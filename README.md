# BFlight
Game for an ESP8266 with SSD1306 and buttons.

Hardware was originally inspired by the BSides Cape Town 2016 Badge and original source code is here

For Arduino, I was using SSD1306 Brzo libraries and I think that's it.

For linux build you need ncurses-dev , cmake and gcc
Most systems can install this with a 'sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev'

For Windows build you will need cmake as well as Visual Studio and optionally Visual Studio Code.

There's no tests, tut - tut, but I did a lot of play testing :)
